This

00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:00.710
is

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.380
99%

Mars.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.020
The

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:04.320
five

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:04.650
basic

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.100

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:05.920
design

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.280
according

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.550
to the

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.370
North American

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.620
Vexillological

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.480
Association.

Vex

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.360
illo

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.010
logical

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.820
Vexillology

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.320
is the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.150
study of

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.720
flags

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.010
It's the

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:14.190
extra

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.650
'lol'

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.030
that makes

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.370
it sound

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:15.720
weird

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.140
Number

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.440
one.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.740
Keep

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:17.330
it simple.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.910
The flag

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:18.230
should be

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.900
so simple

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.160
that a

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.520
child

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.020
can draw it

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:20.660
from memory.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.650
Before I

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.940
moved to

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:22.460
Chicago,

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.280
in 2005,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:23.630
I didn't

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.880
even

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.460
know cities

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.750
had

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.090
their own

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:25.590
flags.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:26.000
"Most

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.480

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.260

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.770
flags."

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:28.210
Well I didn't

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.740
know that.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.580
That's Ted K.,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:30.080
by the way,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.580
flag expert,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.400
totally awesome

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.770

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.090
"I'm

first city flag

is a beaut

A white

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.700

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.440
represent 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.380
the water, 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.300
the lake, and the rivers.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.580
Use
